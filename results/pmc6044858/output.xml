      <abstract>
        <p>Vascular leakage is one of the salient characteristics of severe dengue. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of dengue virus (DENV) can stimulate endothelial cells to secrete endothelial hyperpermeability factor, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), and the glycocalyx degradation factor heparanase 1 (HPA-1). However, it is unclear whether MIF is directly involved in NS1-induced glycocalyx degradation. In this study, we observed that among NS1, MIF and glycocalyx degradation-related molecules, the HPA-1, metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and syndecan 1 (CD138) serum levels were all increased in dengue patients, and only NS1 and MIF showed a positive correlation with the CD138 level in severe patients. To further characterize and clarify the relationship between MIF and CD138, we used recombinant NS1 to stimulate human cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and challenge mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our tabulated results suggested that NS1 stimulation could induce human endothelial cells to secrete HPA-1 and immune cells to secrete MMP-9, resulting in endothelial glycocalyx degradation and hyperpermeability. Moreover, HPA-1, MMP-9, and CD138 secretion after NS1 stimulation was blocked by MIF inhibitors or antibodies both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in mice. Taken together, these results suggest that MIF directly engages in dengue NS1-induced glycocalyx degradation and that targeting MIF may represent a possible therapeutic approach for preventing dengue-induced vascular leakage.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a flavivirus that infects approximately 390 million people and causes 500,000 infections requiring hospitalization every year, with an associated mortality rate of 2.5% [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. DENV infection usually causes a flu-like illness, known as dengue fever (DF), which is associated with high-grade fever and joint pain. Most dengue patients recover without hospitalization, but in some cases, patients develop potentially deadly complications called dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS). According to the latest guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO), dengue severity can be classified into dengue with or without warning signs and severe dengue. One of the main characteristics of DHF/DSS or severe dengue is plasma leakage. The increase in vascular permeability is the primary cause of plasma leakage, which finally causes hypotension and circulatory collapse. Because the mechanism underlying vascular hyperpermeability during DENV infection is not yet fully understood, and no specific approved treatments are available; only supporting treatments, such as fluid therapy, are available.</p>
      <p>An increase in endothelial permeability is frequently associated with the degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Under normal physiological conditions, the glycocalyx acts as a barrier that controls numerous physiological processes, especially preventing the adhesion of leucocytes and platelets to the vessel walls [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Degradation of the endothelial glycocalyx correlates to several vascular pathologies, including sepsis [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Shedding of the endothelial glycocalyx is related to the activation of a heparan sulfate-specific heparanase, HPA-1 [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Activated HPA-1 enhances shedding of the transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 (CD138) and elevates the level of CD138 in the bloodstream [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are capable of digesting many types of extracellular matrix, including the endothelial glycocalyx [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Glycocalyx degradation is strongly associated with severe plasma leakage in dengue patients [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the mechanisms causing glycocalyx degradation during DENV infection are not fully understood.</p>
      <p>Recently, DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) was found to play an important role in the pathogenesis of DENV-induced vascular leakage [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, NS1 can induce the expression and activation of HPA-1, leading to endothelial glycocalyx degradation and hyperpermeability [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In our previous study, we found that DENV NS1 can increase vascular permeability through macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-induced autophagy [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. MIF is a chemokine-like inflammatory cytokine that binds to cell surface receptors (CD74 and/or CXCR2/4/7) and activates downstream signals, such as MAPK/ERK, to modulate inflammatory and immune responses [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>–<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. DENV infection can induce MIF secretion [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and the concentration of MIF is positively correlated with dengue severity [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Furthermore, DENV infection-induced disease was found to be less severe in MIF knockout (<italic>Mif</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup>) mice than in normal mice [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether MIF is directly involved in NS1-induced glycocalyx degradation. To address this question, we studied the effects of NS1 on the secretion of MIF, HPA-1, MMP-9, and CD138 both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that the levels of MIF, HPA-1, MMP-9, and CD138 were all increased in the serum of dengue patients. Similar results were found both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> after recombinant NS1 challenge. Most importantly, the NS1-induced increases in HPA-1, MMP-9, and CD138 were all inhibited in the presence of MIF inhibitors or antibodies both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, indicating that NS1-induced MIF secretion may play an important role in the pathogenesis of DENV NS1-induced glycocalyx degradation and vascular leakage.</p>

        <title>Comparison of NS1, HPA-1, MMP-9, CD138 and MIF serum concentrations in dengue patients</title>
        <p>The concentrations of NS1 and glycocalyx degradation-related molecules in serum samples from healthy donors and dengue patients were measured by ELISA. The concentrations of NS1 and HPA-1 were increased in both dengue patients with warning signs and severe dengue patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). The concentrations of MMP-9 were also significantly elevated in dengue patients with warning signs but not in severe dengue patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The concentrations of CD138 and MIF were significantly elevated in the serum of severe dengue patients compared to dengue patients with warning signs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>). To further elucidate the correlation between CD138 and the other molecules, the serum concentrations of NS1, MIF, HPA-1 and MMP-9 in severe dengue patients were plotted against the concentration of CD138 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Only NS1 and MIF showed a positive correlation with CD138 in the sera of severe dengue patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). Additionally, the viral load of severe dengue patients did not show a significantly positive correlation with any factor mentioned above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). These results suggest that NS1 and MIF may play important roles in CD138 shedding in severe dengue patients.</p>

        <title>DENV NS1-induced endothelial HPA-1 secretion leads to glycocalyx degradation and hyperpermeability and is MIF dependent</title>
        <p>According to a previous study, NS1 can induce endothelial cells to secrete HPA-1 to disrupt the endothelial glycocalyx, and this disruption is characterized by CD138 shedding [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To further investigate the underlying mechanism of NS1-induced HPA-1 secretion, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were stimulated with NS1 for various durations. The results show that CD138 was significantly increased in cell culture medium after 24 h of NS1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). To confirm that this effect was induced by NS1, anti-NS1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was used to block the effect of NS1. Anti-NS1 mAb 2E8, which can inhibit NS1-induced vascular leakage, was able to inhibit NS1-induced CD138 shedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In contrast, another anti-NS1 mAb (DN5C6), which was used as a negative control, failed to inhibit NS1-induced CD138 shedding from endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. NS1 stimulation also increased the active HPA-1 level in endothelial cell lysates, which was abolished by mAb 2E8 but not control mouse IgG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s003">S2A Fig</xref>). To confirm that HPA-1 is involved in NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability and CD138 shedding, recombinant HPA-1 protein and the HPA-1 inhibitor OGT 2115 were used. Inoculating the mice with native but not heat-denatured recombinant HPA-1 directly induced vascular leakage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s003">S2B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, cotreatment with OGT 2115 attenuated NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) and reduced CD138 release to levels similar to those of the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</p>

Furthermore, the conditioned medium obtained from NS1-stimulated HUVECs could induce endothelial hyperpermeability and CD138 shedding after incubation with another HUVEC monolayer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s004">S3B and S3C Fig</xref>). To clarify which protein mediates NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability and CD138 shedding, MIF-blocking antibodies, the HPA-1 inhibitor OGT 2115 and NS1-blocking antibodies were used. The results show that both the anti-MIF antibodies and OGT 2115 attenuated NS1-stimulated conditioned medium-induced HUVEC hyperpermeability and CD138 shedding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s004">S3D and S3E Fig</xref>). Interestingly, the NS1-blocking antibody 2E8 only partially diminished the conditioned medium-induced HUVEC hyperpermeability but not the conditioned medium-induced HUVEC CD138 shedding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s004">S3D and S3E Fig</xref>). Cotreatment with MIF inhibitors (anti-MIF antibodies, ISO-1, and p425) and NS1 also attenuated the NS1-induced HPA-1 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g003">Fig 3E</xref>) and CD138 shedding of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). In addition, we also visualized the HPA-1 expression, CD138 deposition and sialic acid expression using immunofluorescence with anti-HPA antibodies, anti-CD138 antibodies and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectin which can bind to sialic acids and other sugars such as <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g003">Fig 3G</xref>, NS1-induced HPA-1 expression, CD138 deposition and sialic acid degradation could also be rescued by MIF inhibition. However, the HPA-1 inhibitor OGT 2115 failed to affect MIF secretion, suggested that MIF is the upstream effector of HPA-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s004">S3F Fig</xref>). To further clarify this hypothesis, recombinant MIF was used. The results show that MIF increased CD138 shedding and the active HPA-1 level in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s005">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>). The increased HPA-1 expression and CD138 deposition after MIF stimulation could also be observed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s005">S4C Fig</xref>). These results indicate that NS1 can induce the MIF-mediated secretion of active HPA-1, leading to endothelial glycocalyx degradation.</p>

        <title>DENV NS1 induces MMP-9 secretion in THP-1 cells and leukocytes</title>
        <p>Since MMPs can degrade the endothelial glycocalyx and several MMPs are upregulated during DENV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we speculated that MMPs are involved in NS1-induced glycocalyx degradation. Because a previous study has indicated that an increase in circulating MMP-9 levels is associated with dengue disease severity [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we first examined whether NS1 induces MMP-9 secretion. However, we found that NS1 barely induced MMP-9 secretion in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Since MMPs are primarily secreted by leukocytes (white blood cells, WBCs), including neutrophils and monocytes [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], we tested whether NS1 could induce MMP secretion in human leukocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and THP-1 human monocytes. We found that NS1 induced MMP-9 secretion in freshly isolated leukocytes after 3 h of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), an effect that was attenuated by the NS1-blocking antibody 2E8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Similarly, NS1 induced phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-activated THP-1 cells to secrete MMP-9 after incubation for 3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). However, neither MIF nor MMP-9 secretion was significantly induced in NS1-stimulated PBMCs compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s006">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>). To obtain the secretion profile of MMPs, we used an MMP antibody array to analyze which MMPs were increased by NS1 in PMA-activated THP-1 cells and leukocytes.

To confirm the activity of MMP-9, cell culture medium from NS1-treated PMA-activated THP-1 cells and leukocytes were analyzed using a gelatin zymography assay, which showed that NS1 induced both THP-1 cells and leukocytes to secrete pro-MMP-9 and activated MMP-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g004">Fig 4F</xref>).</p>

First, we wanted to confirm whether NS1 induces the secretion of MIF from leukocytes and THP-1 cells. Since a previous study has shown that NS1 increases the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in PBMCs [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], we also measured the concentrations of IL-6 and IL-8 after NS1 stimulation. The secretion of MIF from NS1-stimulated leukocytes steadily accumulated up to 2000 pg/ml (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s008">S7A Fig</xref>). NS1 could also enhance the secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 from leukocytes, but the concentrations dropped rapidly after 3 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s008">S7 B and S7C Fig</xref>). However, in THP-1 cells, NS1 only enhanced the secretion of MIF, not IL-6 or IL-8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s008">S7D–S7F Fig</xref>). These results suggest that MIF is the major cytokine induced by the DENV NS1 stimulation of leukocytes and monocytes.</p>
        <p>To clarify whether NS1-induced MMP-9 secretion is mediated by MIF, the MIF inhibitor p425 and MIF short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) were used. The ELISA results show that inhibiting MIF with its inhibitor p425 abolished NS1-induced MMP-9 secretion, while p425 alone did not affect MMP-9 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Next, we used shRNA to knockdown MIF expression in THP-1 cells. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of MIF was diminished by shMIF compared to the shLuc scrambled control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Furthermore, the knockdown of MIF decreased NS1-induced MMP-9 secretion from THP-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), and the culture supernatant from shMIF THP-1 cells failed to increase endothelial permeability or CD138 shedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). We also knocked down MIF expression in HUVECs and measured the permeability under NS1 stimulation as a comparison.

However, only the concentrations of NS1 and MIF showed a positive correlation with CD138 in severe dengue patients.

Most importantly, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data showed that dengue NS1-induced HPA-1 and MMP-9 secretion was MIF dependent.

          <title>The proposed mechanisms of DENV NS1-induced endothelial glycocalyx degradation.</title>
          <p>Circulating DENV NS1 may bind to endothelial cells via TLR4 or other molecules to stimulate the secretion of MIF, which in turn elevates the protein level of active HPA-1, causing it to digest glycocalyx on the intravascular luminal surface of endothelial cells. On the other hand, NS1 can also bind to TLR4 on leukocytes to secrete MMP-9, causing glycocalyx degradation. Even though the effector molecules causing glycocalyx degradation (HPA-1 and MMP-9) are different, MIF is part of both HPA-1 secretion by endothelial cells and MMP-9 secretion by leukocytes.</p>

      <p>Previously, Puerta-Guardo <italic>et al</italic>. showed that HPA-1 is involved in NS1-induced glycocalyx degradation and hyperpermeability [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, MMPs were not discussed in the mechanism, even though they are the main enzymes that degrade endothelial glycocalyx [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It is known that DENV infection induces dendritic cells to secrete MMP-9 [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, we further demonstrated that the NS1 stimulation of leukocytes but not endothelial cells nor PBMCs could induce MMP-9 secretion. It is known that DENV NS1 can induce neutrophil extracellular traps, which results in the release of tertiary granules containing MMP-9 [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. A previous study has also shown that MIF can mediate the secretion of MMP-9 from neutrophils [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Since neutrophils are a major population of leukocytes, taken together, these results suggest that NS1-stimulated neutrophils may represent the main contributors to MMP-9 secretion in the blood. Therefore, even though neutrophils are not the primary target of DENV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], the secretion of MMP-9 from neutrophils induced by NS1 may also contribute to vascular leakage during DENV infection.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, although it has been shown in previous studies that the concentrations of MMPs are increased in dengue patients [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and MMP-9 upregulation is positively correlated with the disease severity and vascular leakage of dengue [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we observed a significant increase in the serum level of MMP-9 only in dengue patients with warning signs, not in severe dengue patients. From the <italic>in vivo</italic> mouse study, we noticed that the secretion of MMP-9 occurred within a smaller time window than that of HPA-1 in mice after NS1 challenge. Therefore, it is possible that the discrepancy in the MMP-9 level in dengue patients between this and previous studies may be due to differences in the timing of sample collection. Because the specific day post-onset of symptoms that samples were collected was not available in the records of our dengue patients, we could not exclude the possibility of variation arising from different sampling times. Further study monitoring the sequential changes in the serum levels of MMP-9 and other glycocalyx-related molecules along with disease development is required to clarify their roles in dengue pathogenesis.</p>
      <p>From the results of the MMP antibody array, we also found that MMP-8 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP-1) were upregulated by NS1-stimulated leukocytes. TIMP-1, which is a potent inhibitor of MMPs, can form a complex with pro-MMP-9 at a 1:1 stoichiometric relationship to inhibit its activation [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, neutrophil elastase can inactivate TIMP-1 in the complex to free pro-MMP-9, such that it can be activated by MMP-3 [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, myeloperoxidase, which is most abundantly expressed by neutrophils, can also inactivate TIMP-1 via generating hypochlorous acid [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These possible mechanisms may explain why MMP-9 activity was not abrogated in the presence of TIMP-1 in NS1-stimulated leukocytes.</p>
      <p>A previous study has shown that NS1 can induce PBMCs to secrete IL-6 and IL-8 via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), leading to vascular leakage [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, in this study, we found that the secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 dropped rapidly after 3 h of NS1-stimulation in leukocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s008">S7B and S7C Fig</xref>). In contrast, MIF steadily accumulated in the supernatant of leukocyte cultures after NS1 treatment, and the concentration of MIF was higher than that of IL-6 and IL-8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s008">S7 Fig</xref>). As NS1 needs at least 24 h to induce endothelial glycocalyx degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007033.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), we speculated that IL-6 and IL-8 are not very involved in NS1-induced endothelial glycocalyx degradation. This speculation is consistent with a recent study performed by Glasner <italic>et al</italic>., which found that DENV NS1 does not induce HMEC-1 human endothelial cells to secrete TNF-α, IL-6 or IL-8 and that blocking these cytokines does not affect DENV NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. On the other hand, the same study found that inhibition of HPA-1 prevents DENV NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]; however, MIF was not measured. In our previous study and in this study, we demonstrated that NS1 induced HMEC-1 cells or HUMECs to secrete MIF, causing endothelial hyperpermeability [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, we further demonstrated that both the secretion of HPA-1 and the shedding of CD138 induced by NS1-stimulation of endothelial cells are mediated by MIF.</p>
      <p>Due to MIF regulating the secretion of both MMP-9 and HPA-1 and because CD138 shedding was also directly affected by MIF signaling, MIF may be an upstream regulator of DENV NS1-induced glycocalyx degradation. However, the mechanism of how MIF causes HPA-1 and MMP-9 secretion is still unclear. A previous study has shown that MIF induces MMP-9 expression in macrophages via the MAPK pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. MIF is also known to activate NF-κB signaling through binding to CD74 [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Additionally, HPA-1 mRNA expression is elevated in an NF-κB-dependent manner during hypoxia [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that MIF contributes to the secretion of HPA-1 and MMP-9 via the MAPK/NF-κB pathway. However, from our <italic>in vivo</italic> study, we also noticed that NS1-induced MMP-9 secretion and CD138 shedding were significantly attenuated by MIF inhibition, whereas the attenuation of HPA-1 secretion was not as significant. Serum samples from severe dengue patients also showed no linear relationship between the concentrations of MIF and HPA-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007033.s011">S10 Fig</xref>). These results may suggest that in addition to MIF, other factors may participate in the regulation of HPA-1 secretion <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>Taken together, our results suggest that NS1 may contribute to vascular leakage through different mechanisms during DENV infection. DENV NS1 may bind to the TLR4 of leukocytes, inducing the secretion of cytokines and MMPs, or it may directly bind to endothelial cells, inducing the secretion of HPA-1, both of which can cause glycocalyx degradation and subsequent vascular leakage. Consequently, NS1 may represent an important viral factor that causes vascular leakage and glycocalyx degradation during DENV infection. Indeed, antibodies against NS1 have been shown to be protective against DENV infection in mice [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Furthermore, MIF may represent the primary host factor that mediates NS1-induced glycocalyx degradation. Studies focusing on the development of neutralizing antibodies or small molecules against MIF may facilitate the development of drugs to prevent or treat severe dengue [<xref rid="ppat.1007033.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p>

        <title>Experimental design</title>
        <p>The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism of DENV infection-induced endothelial glycocalyx degradation. From analyzing clinical samples, we correlated glycocalyx degradation to MIF secretion. By applying the results from other studies, we hypothesized that HPA-1 or MMP-9 was involved in MIF-mediated glycocalyx degradation in dengue. This hypothesis was examined via <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, which were carried out by recombinant NS1 stimulation, as it was indicated as an important effector in severe dengue. Since the interaction between different cell types is critical under physiological conditions, we assessed the DENV NS1-induced effects on both endothelial cells and leukocytes. To further elucidate the involvement of MMPs in this mechanism, MMP antibody array and gelatin zymography assays were performed. Subsequently, recombinant NS1 was injected into mice systemically or locally to confirm the involvement of MIF, HPA-1 and MMP-9 in NS1-induced endothelial glycocalyx degradation and hyperpermeability <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
