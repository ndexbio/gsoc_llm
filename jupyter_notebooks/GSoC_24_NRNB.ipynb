              "'cocalyx is related to the activation of a heparan sulfate-specific heparanase, HPA-1 [5, 8].\\nActivated HPA-1 enhances shedding of the transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan syn-\\ndecan-1 (CD138) and elevates the level of CD138 in the bloodstream [7, 9, 10]. In addition,\\nmatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are capable of digesting many types of extracellular matrix,\\nincluding the endothelial glycocalyx [11, 12]. Glycocalyx degradation is strongly associated\\nwith severe plasma leakage in dengue patients [13, 14]. However, the mechanisms causing gly-\\ncocalyx degradation during DENV infection are not fully understood.\\nRecently, DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) was found to play an important role in the\\npathogenesis of DENV-induced vascular leakage [15–17]. In addition, NS1 can induce the\\nexpression and activation of HPA-1, leading to endothelial glycocalyx degradation and hyper-\\npermeability [18]. In our previous study, we found that DENV NS1 can increase vascular per-\\nmeability through macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-induced autophagy [19].\\nMIF is a chemokine-like inflammatory cytokine that binds to cell surface receptors (CD74\\nand/or CXCR2/4/7) and activates downstream signals, such as MAPK/ERK, to modulate\\ninflammatory and immune responses [20–25]. DENV infection can induce MIF secretion [26,\\n27], and the concentration of MIF is positively correlated with dengue severity [28]. Further-\\nmore, DENV infection-induced disease was found to be less severe in MIF knockout (Mif-/-)\\nmice than in normal mice [29]. However, it is unclear whether MIF is directly involved in\\nNS1-induced glycocalyx degradation. To address this question, we studied the effects of NS1\\non the secretion of MIF, HPA-1, MMP-9, and CD138 both in vitro and in vivo. We found that\\nthe levels of MIF, HPA-1, MMP-9, and CD138 were all increased in the serum of dengue\\npatients. Similar results were found both in vitro and in vivo after recombinant NS1 challenge.\\nMost importantly, the NS1-induced increases in HPA-1, MMP-9, and CD138 were all inhib-\\nited in the presence of MIF inhibitors or antibodies both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that\\nNS1-induced MIF secretion may play an important role in the pathogenesis of DENV NS1-in-\\nduced glycocalyx degradation and vascular leakage.\\nMIF in DENV NS1-induced endothelial glycocalyx degradation and hyperpermeability\\nPLOS Pathogens | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1007033\\nApril 27, 2018\\n2 / 22\\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared\\nthat no competing interests exist.\\nResults\\nComparison of NS1, HPA-1, MMP-9, CD138 and MIF serum\\nconcentrations in dengue patients\\nThe concentrations of NS1 and glycocalyx degradation-related molecules in serum samples\\nfrom healthy donors and dengue patients were measured by ELISA. The concentrations of\\nNS1 and HPA-1 were increased in both dengue patients with warning signs and severe dengue\\npatients (Fig 1A and 1B). The concentrations of MMP-9 were also significantly elevated in\\ndengue patients with warning signs but not in severe dengue patients (Fig 1C). The concentra-\\ntions of CD138 and MIF were significantly elevated in the serum of severe dengue patients\\ncompared to dengue patients with warning signs (Fig 1D and 1E). To further elucidate the cor-\\nrelation between CD138 and the other molecules, the serum concentrations of NS1, MIF,\\nHPA-1 and MMP-9 in severe dengue patients were plotted against the concentration of\\nCD138 (Fig 2). Only NS1 and MIF showed a positive correlation with CD138 in the sera of\\nsevere dengue patients (Fig 2A and 2B). Additionally, the viral load of severe dengue patients\\ndid not show a significantly positive correlation with any factor mentioned above (S1 Fig).\\nThese results suggest that NS1 and MIF may play important roles in CD138 shedding in severe\\ndengue patients.\\nDENV NS1-induced endothelial HPA-1 secretion leads to glycocalyx\\ndegradation and hyperpermeability and is MIF dependent'"
